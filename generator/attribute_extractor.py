List 8 to 12 relevant system or service attributes that can be mapped to general engineering parameters. Each attribute should be:
- Concise (2â€“4 words)
- Expressed as measurable or controllable properties (e.g., response time, material strength, user error rate)
- Neutral in direction (don't assume good or bad)
